       <p>
  I’m Gurneet Kaur, a B.Sc. Honours Applied Computer Science student (Minor: Mathematics) at The University of Winnipeg, expected to graduate in April 2027. I enjoy building clean, reliable software and turning ideas into user-friendly experiences.
  <br><br>
  Outside of tech, a few things that describe me:
  <br>
  • Aviation nerd ✈️ — fascinated by planes and all things flying.<br>
  • Big fan of suspense & thriller films (I love spotting the twist before it drops).<br>
  • Long walks to reset and think.

    <h3>✈️ Flight-Status Dashboard</h3>
    <p>
    Built a live dashboard to track real-time flight statuses for Northern Manitoba routes and small airlines. A key challenge was that updates were often scattered across different airline pages and posts, which made it time-consuming for travelers to find the latest information.
  </p>
  <p>
    I designed the dashboard to bring those updates together into one clean, easy-to-scan view, optimized for low-bandwidth environments and public displays. The UI focuses on clarity (status, time, delays/cancellations) so people can understand changes quickly without digging through multiple sources.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Made flight updates easier to access by centralizing scattered status information into a single place, reducing confusion and improving decision-making for travelers and community members—especially when schedules change.</p>
  <p><strong>Tech:</strong> JavaScript, HTML/CSS, REST APIs</p>

    <h3>📊 Northwind SLA Analytics System</h3>
    <p>
    Built an end-to-end ETL + analytics pipeline to measure SLA performance from raw order and shipping data. The main problem I wanted to solve was that “late delivery” isn’t always obvious in messy operational data — teams may know something feels off, but without consistent metrics it’s hard to prove where delays happen and why.
  </p>
  <p>
    I designed a star-schema model in PostgreSQL and created transformations to calculate lead time, on-time vs late delivery flags, and late-delivery buckets. I also added SQL validation checks to catch data quality issues early, and containerized the setup with Docker so the environment could be reproduced quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    I then connected the cleaned metrics to Power BI to create visuals that make trends easy to spot (for example: which shipping methods, time periods, or customers correlate with more late deliveries).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Turned scattered operational data into clear, auditable SLA insights—making it easier to identify delay patterns, communicate performance, and prioritize what to improve first.</p>
  <p><strong>Tech:</strong> SQL, Docker, PostgreSQL, Power BI</p>

        <h3>Undergraduate Research Assistant – University of Winnipeg</h3>
        <p>
          Faculty research project required a reliable real-time data collection and processing system for experimental analysis with minimal manual intervention. Developed Python scripts to collect, clean, and analyze real-time sensor data using Raspberry Pi 5, implementing automated data processing pipelines and validation checks. Improved data signal reliability for experimental analysis, reduced manual data processing time, and enabled consistent data collection for ongoing research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complex technical implementation with multiple unknowns required a systematic approach to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. Applied strong problem-solving skills to break down complex technical tasks into smaller testable components, designed controlled tests, and evaluated multiple implementation approaches. Documented workflows, procedures, and test results with detailed explanations and rationale to support research continuity and team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributed to a faculty-supervised research paper by supporting data handling, writing analytical sections, and applying critical-thinking skills while adhering to confidentiality restrictions. Successfully contributed to academic research output while developing technical writing skills.
